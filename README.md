#Maelstrom-Scripts
Maelstrom was a 3.3.5 Semi-Blizzlike project with innovative content. Our idea was to add some utilities and mechanisms to the game so that it becomes
more enjoyable, more fun and more social. We wanted players to rediscover Wrath of the Lich King with pleasure.

Unfortunately, for some personal reasons we decided to stop this project. Therefore, *we will give away the scripts that we already had implemented*. **All the scripts have been implemented and tested only under the latest TrinityCore 3.3.5 version.**

Each directory contains one script and the instructions to add it to your own server. If you have any problem, please create a new issue (french or english only).

If you like our scripts, please give a star to this repo !

The scripts will be added progressively because they require some tweaks in order to be usable by the community.

You can do whatever you want with those scripts, except selling them !

If you use our scripts, we would appreciate a link towards this repo or just a note saying where it comes from.

#Thanks
A big thank-you to all the people who supported us for the Maelstrom project !
